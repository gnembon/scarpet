<div class="block"><h1>Fundamental components of <code>scarpet</code> programming language.</h1>

 <p>Scarpet (a.k.a. Carpet Script, or Script for Carpet) is a programming language designed to provide
 the ability to write custom programs to run within Minecraft and
 interact with the world.</p>

 <p>The project was initially built based on the EvalEx project,
 however it now diverged so far away from the original implementation,
 it would be hard to tell it without this mention.
 EvalEx is a handy expression evaluator for Java, that
 allows to evaluate simple mathematical and boolean expressions.
 For more information, see:
 <a href="https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx">EvalEx GitHub
 repository</a></p>

 <p>This specification is divided into two sections: this one is agnostic
 to any Minecraft related features and could function on its own, and <a href="../../carpet/script/CarpetExpression.html" title="class in carpet.script"><code>CarpetExpression</code></a> for
 Minecraft specific routines and world manipulation functions.</p>

 <h1>Synopsis</h1>

 <pre>
 script run print('Hello World!')
 </pre>
 <p>or an overly complex example:</p>
 <pre>
 /script run
 $    block_check(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, block_to_check) ->
 $    (
 $        l(minx, maxx) = sort(l(x1, x2));
 $        l(miny, maxy) = sort(l(y1, y2));
 $        l(minz, maxz) = sort(l(z1, z2));
 $        'Need to compute the size of the area of course';
 $        'Cause this language doesn\'t support comments';
 $        xsize = maxx - minx + 1;
 $        ysize = maxy - miny + 1;
 $        zsize = maxz - minz + 1;
 $        total_count = 0;
 $        loop(xsize,
 $            xx = minx + _ ;
 $            loop(ysize,
 $                yy = miny + _ ;
 $                loop(zsize,
 $                    zz = minz + _ ;
 $                    if ( block(xx,yy,zz) == block_to_check,
 $                        total_count += ceil(rand(1))
 $                    )
 $                )
 $            )
 $        );
 $        total_count
 $    );
 $    check_area_around_closest_player_for_block(block_to_check) ->
 $    (
 $        closest_player = players();
 $        l(posx, posy, posz) = query(closest_player, 'pos');
 $        total_count = block_check( posx-8,1,posz-8, posx+8,17,posz+8, block_to_check);
 $        print('There is '+total_count+' of '+block_to_check+' around you')
 $    )

 /script invoke check_area_around_closest_player_for_block 'diamond_ore'
 </pre>
 <p>or simply</p>
 <pre>
 script run print('There is'+for(rect(x,9,z,8,8,8), _ == 'diamond_ore')+' diamond ore around you')
 </pre>
 <p>It definitely pays to check what higher level <code>scarpet</code> functions have to offer</p>
 <h1>Programs</h1>
 <p>
 You can think of an program like a mathematical expression, like
 <code>"2.4*sin(45)/(2-4)"</code> or  <code>"sin(y)&gt;0 &amp; max(z, 3)&gt;3"</code>
 Writing a program, is like writing a <code>2+3</code>, just a bit longer</p>

 <h2>Basic language components</h2>
 <p>Programs consist of constants, like <code>2</code>, <code>3.14</code>, <code>pi</code>, or <code>'foo'</code>,
 operators like <code>+</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>-&gt;</code>, variables which you can define, like <code>foo</code>
 or special ones that will be defined for you, like <code>_x</code>, or <code>_</code> , which I specific to
 a each built in function, and functions with name, and arguments in the form of <code>f(a,b,c)</code>, where
 <code>f</code> is the function name, and <code>a, b, c</code> are the arguments which can be any other expression.
 And that's all the parts of the language, so all in all - sounds quite simple.</p>

 <h2>Code flow</h2>
 <p>
     Like any other proper programming language, <code>scarpet</code> needs brackets, basically to identify
     where stuff begins and where it ends. In the languages that uses much more complicated constructs, like Java,
     they tend to use all sort of them, round ones to indicate function calls, curly to indicate section of code,
     square to access lists, pointy for generic types etc... I mean - there is no etc, cause they have exhausted
     all the bracket options...
 </p>
 <p><code>Scarpet</code> is different, since it runs everything based on functions (although its not per se a functional language like lisp)
 only needs the round brackets for everything, and it is up to the programmer to organize its code so its readable,
 as adding more brackets does not have any effect on the performance of the programs as they are compiled before they are executed.
 Look at the following example usage of <code>if()</code> function:
 </p>
 <pre>
 if(x&lt;y+6,set(x,8+y,z,'air');plop(x,top('surface',x,z),z,'birch'),sin(query(player(),'yaw'))&gt;0.5,plop(0,0,0,'boulder'),particle('fire',x,y,z))
 </pre>
 <p>Would you prefer to read</p>
 <pre>
 if(   x&lt;y+6,
            set(x,8+y,z,'air');
            plop(x,top('surface',x,z),z,'birch'),
       sin(query(player(),'yaw'))&gt;0.5,
            plop(0,0,0,'boulder'),
       particle('fire',x,y,z)
 )
 </pre>
 <p>Or rather:</p>
 <pre>
 if
 (
     x&lt;y+6,
     (
         set(x,8+y,z,'air');
         plop(x,top('surface',x,z),z,'birch')
     ),

     sin(query(player(),'yaw'))&gt;0.5,
     (
         plop(0,0,0,'boulder')
     ),

     particle('fire',x,y,z)
 )
 </pre>
 <p>Whichever style you prefer it doesn't matter. It typically depends on the situation and the complexity of the
 subcomponents. No matter how many whitespaces and extra brackets you add - the code will evaluate to exactly the
 same expression, and will run exactly the same, so make sure your programs are nice and clean so others don't
 have problems with them</p>

 <h2>Functions and scoping</h2>
 <p>
 Users can define functions in the form <code>fun(args....) -&gt; expression </code> and they are compiled and saved
 for further execution in this but also subsequent calls of /script command. This means that once defined functions
 are saved with the world for further use. There are two types of variables,
 global - which are shared anywhere in the code, and those are all which name starts with 'global_', and
 local variables which is everything else and those are only visible inside each function.
 This also means that all the parameters in functions are passed 'by value', not 'by reference'.
 </p>

 <h2>Outer variables</h2>
 <p>Functions can still 'borrow' variables from the outer scope,
 by adding them to the function signature wrapped around built-in function <code>outer</code>. What this does is
 it borrows the reference to that variable from the outer scope to be used inside the function and any modifications to that outer
 variable would result in changes of that value in the outer scope as well. Its like passing the parameters by reference,
 except the calling function itself decides what variables its borrowing and what its name. This can be used to
 return more than one result from a function call, although its a very ugly way of doing it -
 I would still recommend returning a list of values instead.
 Variables from outer scopes have a similar behaviour to, for example, <code>nonlocal</code> variables from python. </p>


 <h2>Line indicators</h2>
 <p>Since the maximum command that can be input to the chat is limited in length, you will be probably inserting your
 programs by pasting them to command blocks, however pasting to command blocks will remove some whitespaces and squish
 your newlines making the code not readable. If you are pasting a program that is perfect and will never cause an error,
 I salute you, but for the most part it is quite likely that your program might break, either at compile time, when
 its initially analyzed, or at execute time, when you suddenly attempt to divide something by zero. In these cases
 you would want to get a meaningful error message, but for that you would need to indicate for the compiler where
 did you put these new lines, since command block would squish them. For that, place  at the beginning
 of the line to let the copiler know where are you. This makes so that <code>$</code> is the only character that is
 illegal in programs, since it will be replaced with new lines. As far as I know, <code>$</code> is not used
 anywhere inside Minecraft identifiers, so this shoudn't hinder the abilities of your programs.</p>
 <p>Consider the following program executed as command block command:</p>
 <pre>
 /script run
 run_program() -&gt; (
   loop( 10,
     foo = floor(rand(10));
     check_not_zero(foo);
     print(_+' - foo: '+foo);
     print('  reciprocal: '+  _/foo )
   )
 );
 check_not_zero(foo) -&gt; (
   if (foo==0, foo = 1)
 )
 </pre>
 <p>Lets say that the intention was to check if the bar is zero and prevent division by zero in print,
 but because the <code>foo</code> is passed as a variable, it never changes the original foo value.
 Because of the inevitable division by zero, we get the following message:
 </p>
 <pre>
 Your math is wrong, Incorrect number format for Infinity at pos 112
 run_program() -&gt; (  loop( 10,    foo = floor(rand(10));    check_not_zero(foo);
 print(_+' - foo: '+foo);     HERE&gt;&gt; print('  reciprocal: '+  _/foo )  ));
 check_not_zero(foo) -&gt; (  if (foo==0, foo = 1))
 </pre>

 As we can see, we got our problem where the result of the mathematical operation was not a number (<code>Infinity</code>, so not a number),
 however by pasting our program
 into the command made it squish the newlines so while it is clear where the error happened and we still can track the error down,
 the position of the error (112) is not very helpful and wouldn't be useful if the program gets significantly longer.
 To combat this issue we can precede every line of the script with dollar signs <code>$</code>:
 <pre>
 /script run
 $run_program() -&gt; (
 $  loop( 10,
 $    foo = floor(rand(10));
 $    check_not_zero(foo);
 $    print(_+' - foo: '+foo);
 $    print('  reciprocal: '+  _/foo )
 $  )
 $);
 $check_not_zero(foo) -&gt; (
 $  if (foo==0, foo = 1)
 $)
 </pre>

 <p>Then we get the following error message</p>

 <pre>
 Your math is wrong, Incorrect number format for Infinity at line 7, pos 5
     print(_+' - foo: '+foo);
      HERE&gt;&gt; print('  reciprocal: '+  _/foo )
   )
 </pre>


 <p>As we can note not only we get much more concise snippet, but also information about the line
 number and position, so means its way easier to locate the potential problems problem</p>

 <p>Obviously that's not the way we intended this program to work. To get it <code>foo</code> modified via
 a function call, we would either return it as a result and assign it to the new variable:
 </p>
 <pre>
     foo = check_not_zero(foo);
     ...
     check_not_zero(foo) -&gt; if(foo == 0, 1, foo)
 </pre>
 <p>.. or convert it to a global variable, which in this case passing as an argument is not required</p>
 <pre>
     global_foo = floor(rand(10));
     check_foo_not_zero();
     ...
     check_foo_not_zero() -&gt; if(global_foo == 0, global_foo = 1)
 </pre>
 <p>.. or scope foo from the outer function - in this case the inner function has to determine what it is accessing</p>
 <pre>
     foo = floor(rand(10));
     check_foo_not_zero();
     ...
     check_foo_not_zero(outer(foo)) -&gt; if(foo == 0, foo = 1)
 </pre>

<p><code>outer</code> scope can only be used in
 function signatures to indicate outer variables. They are not arguments, but still you would want to use
 locally without affecting other uses of foo in your program.
 </p>



 <p>For the most part - passing arguments as values, and using returned values   .
 The main usecase of <code>Scarpet</code> would rather be simpler scripts, default scope for all variables is global, unless variable
 is declared with <code>local</code> scope explicitly.

 <h2>Basic Arithmetic Functions</h2>
 <p>There is bunch of them - they require a number and spit out a number,
 doing what you would expect them to do.</p>
 <h3><code>fact(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Factorial of a number, a.k.a <code>n!</code>, just not in <code>scarpet</code>. Gets big... quick...</p>
 <h3><code>sqrt(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Square root. For other fancy roots, use <code>^</code>, math and yo noggin. Imagine square roots on a tree...</p>
 <h3><code>abs(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Absolut value.</p>
 <h3><code>round(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Closest integer value. Did you know the earth is also round?</p>
 <h3><code>floor(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Highest integer that is still no larger then <code>n</code>. Insert a floor pun here.</p>
 <h3><code>ceil(n)</code></h3>
 <p>First lucky integer that is not smalller than <code>n</code>. As you would expect, ceiling is typically
 right above the floor.</p>
 <h3><code>ln(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Natural logarithm of <code>n</code>. Naturally.</p>
 <h3><code>ln1p(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Natural logarithm of <code>n+1</code>. Very optimistic.</p>
 <h3><code>log10(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Decimal logarithm of <code>n</code>. Its ceiling is the length of its floor.</p>
 <h3><code>log(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Binary logarithm of <code>n</code>. Finally, a proper one, not like the other 100.</p>
 <h3><code>log1p(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Binary logarithm of <code>n+1</code>. Also always positive.</p>
 <h3><code>mandelbrot(a, b, limit)</code></h3>
 <p>Computes the value of the mandelbrot set, for set <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> spot.
 Spot the beetle. Why not.</p>
 <h3><code>min(arg, ...), min(list), max(arg, ...), max(list)</code></h3>
 <p>Compute minimum or maximum of supplied arguments assuming default sortraphical order. In case you are
 missing <code>argmax</code>, just use <code>a ~ max(a)</code>, little less efficient, but still fun.
 </p>
 <p>
 Interesting bit - <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> don't remove variable associations from arguments, which
 means can be used as LHS of assignments (obvious case), or argument spec in function definitions (far less obvious).
 </p>
 <pre>
 a = 1; b = 2; min(a,b) = 3; l(a,b)  =&gt; [3, 2]
 a = 1; b = 2; fun(x, min(a,b)) -&gt; l(a,b); fun(3,5)  =&gt; [5, 0]
 </pre>
 <p>Absolutely no idea, how the latter might be useful in practice. But since it compiles, can ship it.</p>

 <h3><code>relu(n)</code></h3>
 <p>Linear rectifier of <code>n</code>. 0 below 0, n above. Why not. <code>max(0,n)</code>
 with less moral repercussions.</p>
 <h2>Trigonometric / Geometric Functions</h2>
 <h3><code>sin(x)</code></h3>
 <h3><code>cos(x)</code></h3>
 <h3><code>tan(x)</code></h3>
 <h3><code>asin(x)</code></h3>
 <h3><code>acos(x)</code></h3>

 <div style="padding-left: 20px; border-radius: 5px 45px; border:1px solid grey;">
 <p>Efficient use of these functions cangreatly simplify your programs and speed them up, as these functions
 will internalize  most of the operations that need to be applied on multiple values at the same time</p>
 <h2>Basic list operations</h2>
 <h3><code>l(values ...), l(iterator) </code></h3>
 <p>Creates a list of values of the expressions passed as parameters. It can be used as an L-value and if all
 elements are variables, you coujld use it to return multiple results from one function call, if that function returns
 a list of results with the same size as the <code>l</code> call uses. In case there is only one argument and it is
 an iterator (vanilla expression specification has <code>range</code>, but Minecraft API implements
 a bunch of them, like <code>diamond</code>), it will convert it to a proper list. Iterators can only be used in
 high order functions, and are treated as empty lists, unless unrolled with <code>l</code></p>
 <pre>
 l(1,2,'foo') =&gt; [1, 2, foo]
 l() =&gt; [] (empty list)
 l(range(10)) =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 l(1, 2) = l(3, 4) =&gt; Error: l is not a variable
 l(foo, bar) = l(3,4); foo==3 &amp;&amp; bar==4 =&gt; 1
 l(foo, bar, baz) = l(2, 4, 6); l(min(foo, bar), baz) = l(3, 5); l(foo, bar, baz)  =&gt; [3, 4, 5]
 </pre>
 <p>In the last example <code>l(min(foo, bar), baz)</code> creates a valid L-value, as min(foo, bar) finds the
 lower of the variables (in this case <code>foo</code>) creating a valid assignable L-list of [foo, baz], and these
 values will be assigned new values</p>

 <h3><code>join(delim, list), join(delim, values ...) </code></h3>
 <p>Returns a string that contains joined elements of the list, iterator, or all values, concatenated with <code>delim</code> delimiter</p>
 <pre>
     join('-',range(10))  =&gt; 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
     join('-','foo')  =&gt; foo
     join('-', 'foo', 'bar')  =&gt; foo-bar
 </pre>

 <h3><code>split(delim, expr)</code></h3>
 <p>Splits a string undr <code>expr</code> by <code>delim</code> which can be a regular expression</p>
 <pre>
     split('',foo)  =&gt; [f, o, o]
     split('.','foo.bar')  =&gt; []
     split('\\.','foo.bar')  =&gt; [foo, bar]
 </pre>

 <h3><code>slice(expr, from, to?)</code></h3>
 <p>extracts a substring, or sublist (based on the type of the result of the expression under expr with starting index
 of <code>from</code>, and ending at <code>to</code> if provided, or the end, if omitted</p>
 <pre>
     split('',foo)  =&gt; [f, o, o]
     split('.','foo.bar')  =&gt; []
     split('\\.','foo.bar')  =&gt; [foo, bar]
 </pre>



 <h3><code>sort(list), sort(values ...) </code></h3>
 <p>Sorts in the default sortographical order either all arguments, or a list if its the only argument. It returns a new
 sorted list, not affecting the list passed to the argument</p>
 <pre>
 sort(3,2,1)  =&gt; [1, 2, 3]
 sort('a',3,11,1)  =&gt; [1, 3, 11, 'a']
 list = l(4,3,2,1); sort(list)  =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4]
 </pre>

 <h3><code>sort_key(list, key_expr)</code></h3>
 <p>Sorts a copy of the list in the order or keys as defined by the <code>key_expr</code> for each element</p>
 <pre>
     sort_key([1,3,2],_)  =&gt; [1, 2, 3]
     sort_key([1,3,2],-_)  =&gt; [3, 2, 1]
     sort_key(l(range(10)),rand(1))  =&gt; [1, 0, 9, 6, 8, 2, 4, 5, 7, 3]

 </pre>

 <h3><code>range(to), range(from, to), range(from, to, step)</code></h3>
 <p>Creates a range of numbers from <code>from</code>, no greater/larger than <code>limit</code>.
 The <code>step</code> parameter dictates not only the increment size, but also direction (can be negative).
 The returned value is not a proper list, just the iterator
 but if for whatever reason you need a proper list with all items evaluated, use <code>l(range(limit))</code>.
 Primarily to be used in higher order functions</p>
 <pre>
     range(10)  =&gt; [...]
     l(range(10))  =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
     map(range(10),_*_)  =&gt; [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

 </pre>

 <h3><code>element(list, index)</code></h3>
 <p>Returns the value at <code>index</code> element from the <code>list</code>.
 use negative numbers to reach elements from the end of the list. <code>element</code>
 call will always be able to find the index. In case there is few items, it will loop over </p>
 <pre>
     element(l(range(10)), 5)  =&gt; 5
     element(l(range(10)), -1)  =&gt; 9
     element(l(range(10)), 10)  =&gt; 0
     element(l(range(10)), 93)  =&gt; 3
 </pre>

 <h3><code>while(cond, limit, expr)</code></h3>
 <p>Evaluates expression <code>expr</code> repeatedly until condition <code>cond</code> becomes false,
 but not more than <code>limit</code> times. Returns the result of the last <code>expr</code> evaluation,
 or <code>null</code> if nothing was successful. both <code>expr</code> and <code>cond</code> will recveived a
 bound variable <code>_</code> indicating current iteration, so its a number</p>
 <pre>
  while(a&lt;100,10,a=_*_)  =&gt; 81 // loop exhausted via limit
  while(a&lt;100,20,a=_*_)  =&gt; 100 // loop stopped at condition, but a has already been assigned
  while(_*_&lt;100,20,a=_*_)  =&gt; 81 // loop stopped at condition, before a was assigned a value
 </pre>

 <h3><code>loop(num,expr(_),exit(_)?)</code></h3>
 <p>Evaluates expression <code>expr</code>, <code>num</code> number of times. Optionally,
 if <code>cond</code> condition is present, stops the execution if the condition becomes true.
 Both <code>expr</code> and <code>cond</code> receive <code>_</code> system variable indicating the iteration</p>
 <pre>
     loop(5, tick())  =&gt; repeat tick 5 times
     list = l(); loop(5, x = _; loop(5, list += l(x, _) ) ); list
       // double loop, produces: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 0], [1, 1], ... , [4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]]
 </pre>
 <p>In this small example we will search for first 10 primes, apparently including 0:</p>
 <pre>
     check_prime(n) -&gt; !first( range(2, sqrt(n)+1), !(n % _) );
     primes = l();
     loop(10000, if(check_prime(_), primes += _), length(primes) &gt;= 10 );
     primes

     // outputs: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
 </pre>
 <h3><code>map(list,expr(_,_i), exit(_,_i)?)</code></h3>
 <p>Converts a <code>list</code> of values, to another list where each value is result of an expression
 <code>v = expr(_, _i)</code> where <code>_</code> is passed as each element of the list, and <code>_i</code> is
 the index of such element, optional <code>exit</code> condition is evaluated after each mapping and if it is false,
 the map is terminated and returned whatever got collected so far</p>
 <pre>
     map(range(10), _*_)  =&gt; [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
     map(players('*'), _+' is stupid') [gnembon is stupid, herobrine is stupid]
 </pre>

 <h3><code>filter(list,expr(_,_i),exit(_,_i))</code></h3>
 <p>filters <code>list</code> elements returning only these that return positive result of the <code>expr</code>.
 Like with <code>map</code> if the optional condition <code>exit</code> gets true, the list is returned up to this point</p>
 <pre>
     filter(range(100), !(_%5), _*_&gt;1000)  =&gt; [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
     map(filter(entities_list('all'),_=='Witch'), query(_,'pos') )  =&gt; [[1082.5, 57, 1243.5]]
 </pre>

 <h3><code>first(list,expr(_,_i))</code></h3>
 <p>Finds and returns the first item in the list that satisfies <code>expr</code>. If sets <code>_</code> for current element value,
 and <code>_i</code> for index of that element</p>
 <pre>
     first(range(1000,10000), n=_; !first( range(2, sqrt(n)+1), !(n % _) ) )  =&gt; 1009 // first prime after 1000
 </pre>
 <p>Notice in the example above, that we needed to rename the outer <code>_</code> to be albe to use in in the inner
 <code>first</code> call</p>


 <h3><code>all(list,expr(_,_i))</code></h3>
 <p>Returns <code>true</code> if all elements on the list satisfy the condition. Its roughly equivalent to
 <code>all(list,expr) &lt;=&gt; for(list,expr)==length(list)</code>, but works with generators. <code>expr</code>
 also receives bound <code>_</code> and <code>_i</code> variables</p>
 <pre>
     all([1,2,3], check_prime(_))  =&gt; 1
     all(neighbours(x,y,z), _=='stone')  =&gt; 1 // if all neighbours of [x, y, z] are stone
     map(filter(rect(0,4,0,1000,0,1000), l(x,y,z)=pos(_); all(rect(x,y,z,1,0,1),_=='bedrock') ), pos(_) )
       =&gt; [[-298, 4, -703], [-287, 4, -156], [-269, 4, 104], [242, 4, 250], [-159, 4, 335], [-208, 4, 416], [-510, 4, 546], [376, 4, 806]]
         // find all 3x3 bedrock structures in the top bedrock layer
     map( filter( rect(0,4,0,1000,1,1000,1000,0,1000), l(x,y,z)=pos(_);
             all(rect(x,y,z,1,0,1),_=='bedrock') &amp;&amp; for(rect(x,y-1,z,1,1,1,1,0,1),_=='bedrock')&lt;8),
        pos(_) )  =&gt; [[343, 3, -642], [153, 3, -285], [674, 3, 167], [-710, 3, 398]]
         // ditto, but requiring at most 7 bedrock block in the 18 blocks below them
 </pre>


 <h3><code>for(list,expr(_,_i),exit(_,_i)?)</code></h3>
 <p>Evaluates expression over list of items from the <code>list</code>, and can optionally stop early if
 <code>exit</code> expression is specified and evaluates <code>true</code> for a given iteration. Supplies
 <code>_</code>(value) and <code>_i</code>(iteration number) to both <code>expr</code> and <code>exit</code>.
 Returns the number of times <code>expr</code> was successful</p>
 <pre>
     check_prime(n) -&gt; !first( range(2, sqrt(n)+1), !(n % _) );
        for(range(1000000,1100000),check_prime(_))  =&gt; 7216
 </pre>
 <p>From which we can learn that there is 7216 primes between 1M and 1.1M</p>
 <h3><code>reduce(list,expr(_a,_,_i), initial)</code></h3>
 <p>Applies <code>expr</code> for each element of the list and saves the result in <code>_a</code> accumulator.
 Consecutive calls to <code>expr</code> can access that value to apply more values. You also need to specify
 the initial value to apply for the accumulator</p>
 <pre>
     reduce([1,2,3,4],_+_,0)  =&gt; 10
     reduce([1,2,3,4],_*_,1)  =&gt; 24

<h4>Operators</h4>
<pre>public&nbsp;void&nbsp;Operators()</pre>
<div class="block"><h1>Operators</h1>
 <div style="padding-left: 20px; border-radius: 5px 45px; border:1px solid grey;">

 <p>There is a number of operators you can use inside the expressions. Those could be considered
 generic type operators that apply to most data types. They also follow standard operator
 precedence, i.e. <code>2+2*2</code> is understood as <code>2+(2*2)</code>,
 not <code>(2+2)*2</code>, otherwise they are applied from left to right, i.e.
 <code>2+4-3</code> is interpreted as <code>(2+4)-3</code>, which in case of numbers
 doesn't matter, but since <code>scarpet</code> allows for mixing all value types
 the associativity would matter, and may lead to unintended effects: </p>
 <p>Important operator is function definition <code>-&gt;</code> operator. It will be covered
 in <a href="../../carpet/script/Expression.html#UserDefinedFunctionsAndControlFlow--"><code>UserDefinedFunctionsAndControlFlow()</code></a></p>
 <pre>
 '123'+4-2 =&gt; ('123'+4)-2 =&gt; '1234'-2 =&gt; '134'
 '123'+(4-2) =&gt; '123'+2 =&gt; '1232'
 3*'foo' =&gt; 'foofoofoo'
 1357-5 =&gt; 1352
 1357-'5' =&gt; 137
 3*'foo'-'o' =&gt; 'fff'
 l(1,3,5)+7 =&gt; l(8,10,12)
 </pre>
 <p>As you can see, values can behave differently when mixed with other types
 in the same expression. in case values are of the same types, the result
 tends to be obvious, but <code>Scarpet</code> tries to make sense of whatever it
 has to deal with</p>
 <h2>Operator Precedence</h2>
 <p>
     Here is the complete list of operators in <code>scarpet</code> including control flow operators.
     note, that commas and brackets are not operators, but behave like them:
     </p>
     <ul>
         <li>Unary <code>+ - !</code></li>
         <li>Exponent <code>^</code></li>
         <li>Multiplication <code>* / %</code></li>
         <li>Addition <code>+ -</code></li>
         <li>Comparison <code>== != &gt; &gt;= &lt;= &lt; ~</code></li>
         <li>Logical And<code>&amp;&amp;</code></li>
         <li>Logical Or <code>||</code></li>
         <li>Assignment <code>= += &lt;&gt;</code></li>
         <li>Definition <code>-&gt;</code></li>
         <li>Next statement<code>;</code></li>
         <li>Comma <code>,</code></li>
         <li>Bracket <code>( )</code></li>
     </ul>

 <h3><code>Basic Arithmetic Operators  +  -  *  /</code></h3>
 <p>Allows to add the results of two expressions. If the operands resolve to numbers, the result is
 arithmetic operation.
 In case of strings, adding or subtracting from a string results in string concatenation and
 removal os substrings from that string. Multiplication of strings and numbers results in repeating the
 string N times and division results in taking the first k'th part of the string, so that <code>str*n/n ~ str</code>
 In case first operand is a list, either it results in a new list
 with all elements modified one by one with the other operand, or if the operand is a list with the same number of
 items - elementwise addition/subtraction</p>
 <p>Examples:</p>
 <pre>
 2+3 =&gt; 5
 'foo'+3+2 =&gt; 'foo32'
 'foo'+(3+2) =&gt; 'foo5'
 3+2+'bar' =&gt; '5bar'
 'foo'*3 =&gt; 'foofoofoo'
 'foofoofoo' / 3 =&gt; 'foo'
 'foofoofoo'-'o' =&gt; 'fff'
 l(1,2,3)+1  =&gt; l(2,3,4)
 b = l(100,63,100); b+l(10,0,10)  =&gt; l(110,63,110)
 </pre>

 <h3><code>Just Operators  %  ^</code></h3>
 <p>The modulo and exponent (power) operators work only if both operands are numbers</p>
 <pre>
 pi^pi%euler  =&gt; 1.124....
 -9 % 4  =&gt; -1
 9 % -4  =&gt; 0 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Java
 -3 ^ 2  =&gt; 9
 -3 ^ pi =&gt; // Error
 </pre>

 <h3><code>Comparison Operators  ==  !=  &lt;  &gt;  &lt;=  &gt;=</code></h3>
 <p>Allows to compare the results of two expressions.
 For numbers it is considers arithmetic order of numbers, for strings - lexicographical,
 nulls are always 'less' than everything else, and lists check their elements - if the sizes
 are different, the size matters, otherwise, pairwise comparisons for each elements are performed.
 The same order rules than with all these operators are used with the default sortographical order as
 used by <code>sort</code> function. All of these are true:
 </p>
 <pre>
 null == null
 null != false
 0 == false
 1 == true
 null &lt; 0
 null &lt; -1000
 1000 &lt; 'a'
 'bar' &lt; 'foo'
 3 == 3.0
 </pre>

 <h3><code>Logical Operators  &amp;&amp;   ||</code></h3>
 <p>These operator compute respective boolean operation on the operands. What it important is that if calculating
 of the second operand is not necessary, it won't be evaluated, which means one can use them as conditional
 statements</p>
 <pre>
 true || false  =&gt; 1
 null || false =&gt; 0
 null != false || run('kill gnembon')  =&gt; 1 // gnembon survives
 null != false &amp;&amp; run('kill gnembon')  =&gt; 0 // when cheats not allowed
 null != false &amp;&amp; run('kill gnembon')  =&gt; 1 // gnembon dies, cheats allowed
 </pre>

 <h3><code>Matching Operator  ~</code></h3>
 <p>This operator should be understood as 'matches', or 'in'. For strings it matches the right operand as a regular
 expression to the left one, returning the first match. This can be used to extract information from unparsed nbt's
 in a more efficient way. For lists it checks if an element is in the list, and returns the index of that element,
 or <code>null</code> if no such element was found, especially that the use of <code>first</code> function will not
 return the index. Currently it doesn't have any special behaviour for numbers - it checks for existence of characters
 in string representation of the left operand with respect of the regular expression on the right hand side.
 string</p>
 <p>in Minecraft API portion <code>entity ~ feature</code> is a shortcode for <code>query(entity,feature)</code>
 for queries that do not take any extra arguments.</p>
 <pre>
 l(1,2,3) ~ 2  =&gt; 1
 l(1,2,3) ~ 4  =&gt; null
 'foobar' ~ '.b'  =&gt; 'ob'
 players('*') ~ 'gnembon'  // null unless player gnembon is logged in (better to use player('gnembon') instead
 p ~ 'sneaking' // if p is an entity returns whether p is sneaking
 </pre>
 <p>Or a longer example of an ineffective way to searching for a squid</p>
 <pre>
 entities = entities_area('all',x,y,z,100,10,100);
 sid = entities ~ 'Squid';
 if(sid != null, run('execute as '+query(element(entities,sid),'id')+' run say I am here '+query(element(entities,sid),'pos') ) )
 </pre>
 <p>Or an example to find if a player has specific enchantment on a held axe (either hand) and get its level
 (despite obvious lack of support for json NBT's):</p>
 <pre>
 global_get_enchantment(p, ench) -&gt; (
 $   for(l('main','offhand'),
 $      holds = query(p, 'holds', _);
 $      if( holds,
 $         l(what, count, nbt) = holds;
 $         if( what ~ '_axe' &amp;&amp; nbt ~ ench,
 $            lvl = max(lvl, number(nbt ~ '(?&lt;=lvl:)\\d') )
 $         )
 $      )
 $   );
 $   lvl
 $);
 /script run global_get_enchantment(players(), 'sharpness')
 </pre>
 <h3><code>Assignment Operators  =  &lt;&gt;  +=</code></h3>
 <p>A set of assignment operators. All require bounded variable on the LHS, <code>&lt;&gt;</code> requires
 bounded arguments on the right hand side as well (bounded, meaning being variables). Additionally they can also
 handle list constructors with all bounded variables, and work then as list assignment operators.
 When <code>+=</code> is used on a list, it extends that list of that element, and returns the list (old == new).
 <code>scarpet</code> doesn't support currently removal of items. Removal of items can be obtaine via
 <code>filter</code> command, and reassigning it fo the same variable. Both operations would require rewriting of the
 array anyways.</p>
 <pre>
 a = 5  =&gt; a == 5
 l(a,b,c) = l(3,4,5) =&gt; a==3, b==4, c==5
 l(minx,maxx) = sort(xi,xj);  // minx assumes min(xi, xj) and maxx, max(xi, xj)
 l(a,b,c,d,e,f) = l(range(6)); l(a,b,c) &lt;&gt; l(d,e,f); l(a,b,c,d,e,f)  =&gt; [3,4,5,0,1,2]
 a = l(1,2,3); a += 4  =&gt; [1,2,3,4]
 a = l(1,2,3,4); a = filter(a,_!=2)  =&gt; [1,3,4]

     a = 1; var('a') = 'foo'; a =&gt; a == 'foo'
 </pre>

 <h3><code>undef(expr)</code></h3>
 <p>Removes all bindings of a variable with a name of <code>expr</code>.
 Removes also all function definitions with that name. It can affect global variable pool, and local variable set
 for a particular function which will become invalid ........, </p>
 <pre>
     inc(i) -&gt; i+1; foo = 5; inc(foo) =&gt; 6
     inc(i) -&gt; i+1; foo = 5; undef('foo'); inc(foo) =&gt; 1
     inc(i) -&gt; i+1; foo = 5; undef('inc'); undef('foo'); inc(foo) =&gt; Error: Function inc is not defined yet at pos 53
     undef('pi')  =&gt; bad idea - removes hidden variable holding the pi value
     undef('true')  =&gt; even worse idea, unbinds global true value, all references to true would now refer to the default 0
 </pre>
 <h3><code>vars(prefix)</code></h3>
 <p>It returns all names of variables from local scope (if prefix does not start with 'global')
 or global variables (otherwise).
 Here is a larger example that uses combination of <code>vars</code> and <code>var</code> functions to
 be used for object counting</p>
 <pre>
 /script run
 $ count_blocks(ent) -&gt; (
 $   l(cx, cy, cz) = query(ent, 'pos');
 $   scan(cx, cy, cz, 16, 16, 16, var('count_'+_) += 1);
 $   for ( sort_key( vars('count_'), -var(_)),
 $     print(str( '%s: %d', slice(_,6), var(_) ))
 $   )
 $ )

 /script run count_blocks(player())

 <h2>Writing programs with more than 1 line</h2>
 <h3><code>Operator ;</code></h3>
 <p>To effectively write programs that have more than one line, a programmer needs way to specify a sequence of
 commands that execute one after another. In <code>scarpet</code> this can be achieved with <code>;</code>. Its an operator,
 and by separating statements with semicolons. And since whitespaces and <code>$</code> signs are all treats as
 whitespaces, how you layout your code doesn't matter, as long as it is readable to everyone involved. The
 usefulness of preceding all the lines of the script with <code>$</code> is explained in the preamble</p>
 <pre>
 expr;
 expr;
 expr;
 expr
 </pre>
 <p>Notice that the last expression is not followed by a semicolon. Since instruction separation is functional
 in <code>scarpet</code>, and not barely an instruction delimiter,
 terminating the code with a dangling operator wouldn't be valid.</p>
 <p>In general <code>expr; expr; expr; expr</code> is equivalent to
 <code>(((expr ; expr) ; expr) ; expr)</code>. In case the programmer forgets that it should be warned with a
 helpful error at compile time.</p>
 <p>Result of the evaluated expression is the same as the result of the second expression, but first expression is
 also evaluated for sideeffects</p>
 <pre>
 expr1 ; expr2 =&gt; expr2  // with expr1 as a sideeffect
 </pre>
 <p>All defined functions are compiled, stored persistently, and available globally -
 accessible to all other scripts. Functions can only be undefined via call to <code>undef('fun')</code>, which
 would erase global entry for function <code>fun</code>. Since all variables have local scope inside each function,
 one way to share large objects is via global variables
 </p>
 <h2>Global variables</h2>
 <p>Any variable that is used with a name that starts with <code>'global_'</code> will be stored and accessible globally,
 not, inside current scope. It will also persist across scripts, so if a procedure needs to use its own construct, it needs to
 define it, or initialize it explicitly, or undefine it via <code>undef</code></p>
 <pre>
 a() -&gt; global_list+=1; global_list = l(1,2,3); a(); a(); global_list  // =&gt; [1,2,3,1,1]
 </pre>
 <h3><code>Operator -&gt;</code></h3>
 <p>To organize code better than a flat sequence of operations, one can define functions. Definition is correct if
 has the following form</p>
 <pre>
     fun(args, ...) -&gt; expr
 </pre>
 <p>Where <code>fun(args, ...)</code> is a function signature indicating function name, number of arguments,
 and their names, and expr is an expression (can be complex) that is evaluated when <code>fun</code> is called.
 Names in the signature don't need to be used anywhere else, other occurrences of these names
 will be masked in this function scope.
 Function call creates new scope for variables inside <code>expr</code>, so all non-global variables are not
 visible from the caller scope. All parameters are passed by value to the new scope, including lists</p>
 <pre>
 a(lst) -&gt; lst+=1; list = l(1,2,3); a(list); a(list); list  // =&gt; [1,2,3]
 </pre>
 <p>In case the inner function wants to operate and modify larger objects, lists from the outer
 scope, but not global, it needs to use <code>outer</code> function in function signature</p>
 <h3><code>outer(arg)</code></h3>
 <p><code>outer</code> function can only be used in the function signature, and it will
 cause an error everywhere else. It borrows the reference to that variable from the outer scope and allows
 its modification in the inner scope. Any modification of outer variable will result in change of them in
 the outer function. In case the variable was not set yet in the outer scope - it will be created. This construct
 is similar to <code>nonlocal</code> scoping from python</p>
 <pre>
 a(outer(list)) -&gt; list+=1; list = l(1,2,3); a(); a(); list  // =&gt; [1,2,3,1,1]
 </pre>
 <p>The return value of a function is the value of the last expression. This as the same effect as using outer
 or global lists, but is more expensive</p>
 <pre>
 a(lst) -&gt; lst+=1; list = l(1,2,3); list=a(list); list=a(list); list  // =&gt; [1,2,3,1,1]
 </pre>
 <p>Ability to combine more statements into one expression, with functions, passing parameters, and global and outer
 scoping allow to organize even larger scripts</p>
 <h2>Control flow</h2>
 <h3><code>return(expr)</code></h3>
 <p>Sometimes its convenient to break the organized control flow, or it is not practical to pass
 the final result value of a function to the last statement, in this case a return statement can be used</p>
 <pre>
 def() -&gt; (
  expr1;
  expr2;
  return(expr3); // function terminates returning expr3
  expr4;     // skipped
  expr5      // skipped
 )
 </pre>
 <p>In general its cheaper to leave the last expression as a return value, rather than calling returns everywhere,
 but it would often lead to a messy code.</p>
 <h3><code>exit(expr)</code></h3>
 <p>It terminates entire program passing <code>expr</code> as the result of the program execution.</p>
 <h3><code>try(expr, catch_expr(_)) ... throw(value)</code></h3>
 <p><code>try</code> function evaluates expression, and continues further unless <code>throw</code> function is called
 anywhere inside <code>expr</code>. In that case the <code>catch_expr</code> is evaluates with <code>_</code> set
 to the argument <code>throw</code> was called with. This mechanism allows to terminate large portion of a convoluted
 call stack and continue program execution. There is only one level of exceptions currently in carpet, so if the inner
 function also defines the <code>try</code> catchment area, it will received the exception first, but it can technically
 rethrow the value its getting for the outer scope. Unhandled throw acts like an exit statement.</p>
 <h3><code>if(cond, expr, cond?, expr?, ..., default?)</code></h3>
 <p>If statement is a function that takes a number of conditions that are evaluated one after another and if
 any of them turns out true, its <code>expr</code> gets returned, otherwise, if all conditions fail, the return value is
 <code>default</code> expression, or <code>null</code> if default is skipped</p>
 <p><code>if</code> function is equivalent to <code>if (cond) expr; else if (cond) expr; else default;</code>
 from Java, just in a functional form </p>

<div class="block"><h1>Variables and Constants</h1>
 <div style="padding-left: 20px; border-radius: 5px 45px; border:1px solid grey;">
 <p><code>scarpet</code> provides a number of constants that can be used literally in scripts</p>
 <ul>
     <li><code>null</code>: nothing, zilch, not even false</li>
     <li><code>true</code>: pure true, or just 1 (one)</li>
     <li><code>false</code>: false truth, or true falsth, 0 (zero) actually</li>
     <li><code>pi</code>: for the fans of perimeters, its a perimeter of an apple pi of diameter 1. About 3.14</li>
     <li><code>euler</code>: clever guy. Derivative of its exponent is goto 1. About 2.72</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Apart from that, there is a bunch of system variables, that start with <code>_</code> that are set by
 <code>scarpet</code> built-ins, like <code>_</code>, typically each consecutive value in loops,
 <code>_i</code> indicating iteration, or <code>_a</code> like an accumulator for <code>reduce</code>
 function. Certain calls to Minecraft specific calls would also set <code>_x</code>,
 <code>_y</code>, <code>_z</code>, indicating block positions. All variables starting with
 <code>_</code> are read-only, and cannot be declared and modified in client code.</p>

 <h2>Literals</h2>
 <p><code>scarpet</code> accepts numeric and string liters constants.
 Numbers look like <code>1, 2.5, -3e-7, 0xff, </code> and are internally represented as Java's <code>double</code>
 but <code>scarpet</code> will try to trim trailing zeros as much as possible so if you need to use them as intergers,
 you can. Strings using single quoting, for multiple reasons, but primarily to allow for easier use of strings inside
 doubly quoted command arguments (when passing a script as a parameter of <code>/script fill</code> for example,
 or when typing in jsons inside scarpet to feed back into a <code>/data merge</code> command for example. Strings also
 use backslashes <code>\</code> for quoting special characters, in both plain strings and regular expressions</p>
 <pre>
 'foo'
 print('This doesn\'t work')
 nbt ~ '\\.foo'   // matching '.' as a '.', not 'any character match'
