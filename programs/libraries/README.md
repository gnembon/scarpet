### pretty_print.sc:
#### By Xendergo
```
Adds a pretty_print() function which is equivalent to print(), but color codes things by type. Helpful for distinguishing between null & 'null', or maps, nbts, and stringified nbts
pretty_print() can take as many arguments as you want and it will print all of them seperated by spaces
If the first argument is a player or list of players, it will print only to the players specified

The colors used are:
null - purple
number - blue
string - orange
list - yellow
map - red
iterator - Darker yellow
function - magenta
task - grey
block - green
entity - Darker red
nbt - cyan
text - Unchanged, usually formatted already
```
