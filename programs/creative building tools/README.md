## Creative building tools scarpet apps in alphabetical order with creator:

### cover.sc
#### By Firigion

Lets you cover a set of blocks with a set of other blocks for ease of spawnproofing a decorative build. To use it, put the block to cover in your offhand and the block to cover it with in your main hand. To do a bunch of different blocks at a time, create pairs by placing a shulker box in the main hand and another one in the off hand. Pairs will be created from matching slots in the boxes. For more info, see [this](https://github.com/Firigion/scarpets#cover).

### curves.sc
#### By Firigion

A tool to help you create helixes, spirals, waves, curvy circles stars _and much more_ (Idk what else, I'm probably forgetting something) parametrically. It comes with built in help command and interactive settings. If you need help or details on how stuff works, see [here](https://github.com/Firigion/scarpets#curves).

### soft_replace.sc
#### By Firigion

Lets you replace blocks in an area with other blocks, preserving their block properties. This way, you can create a beautiful build out of slabs, stairs and log blocks and midway through the design process, change your pallette. See [here](https://github.com/Firigion/scarpets#soft-replace) for more info on how to use it.

### shapes.sc
#### By Firigion

A set of tools to define simple shapes (spheres, discs, circles, lines and planes) in 3D space by setting three points in the world and fitting the shape to those. Also has a fun eraser tool to delete blobs of connected blocks. [Here](https://github.com/Firigion/scarpets#shapes) you can find more specifi information.
