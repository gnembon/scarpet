# Survival scarpet apps
Various scripts that modify various game elements, often replicating popular modded features, intended for use in (but not limited to) survival worlds.

## Survival scarpet apps in alphabetical order with creator:

### [angel_block.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/angel_block.sc):
#### By "Pegasus Epsilon" <pegasus@pimpninjas.org>
	Reimplementation of Angel Blocks from RandomThings mod in scarpet 1.4.
	Angel Block allows players to place a block in the middle of the air or water without having to place any support blocks which is especially helpful when trying to build in mid air or water.

### [auto_lighter.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/auto_lighter.sc):
#### By gnembon
	When the player right clicks with a torch looking into the air and not on a block, this will start to send
	out torches and light up the caves in the 128 block sphere around the player. If the player is in
    survival, it will yeet the torches from its inventory.

	App is multiplayer compatible.

### [auto_pickup.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/auto_pickup.sc):
#### By gnembon
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	When you break a block, the item gets tp-ed to player, and left on ground if the inventory is full.
	Also works for inventory blocks, delaying the check until they are done to grab the items off the ground.

### [bridge.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/bridge.sc):
#### By Aplet123
	When holding golden sword(configurable), sneaking and clicking on a block, the blocks in the offhand will be placed.
	Also comes with useful funcs, __set_nbt_in_slot(player, slot, tag_name, tag_value)
	and __get_nbt_value_in_slot(player, slot, tag_name)
	which can be very useful anywhere.

### [bucketstack.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/bucketstack.sc):
#### By rv3r and Firigion
	Buckets act like honey bottles.
	Set custom stack sizes for any bucket type with /bucketstack <bucket> <stacksize> and the buckets will stack when filled or picked up by a player.
	Stacking requires identical nbt data for buckets of water mobs.
	When using a stack of buckets, receive an empty bucket and continue using the stack as usual, just like honey bottles.
	
	Can't work in creative mode.

### [cam.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/cam.sc):
#### By Gnembon
    As /c /s used to be in the olden 1.15- days, just configurable, safe with anti-cheat mechanisms, saving player landing location in
    app nbt's for future use. The whole shabang.

### [carried_totem.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/carried_totem.sc):
#### By KingOfTheClouds

### [easier_renweable_sponge.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/easier_renweable_sponge.sc):
#### By Ghoulboy
	If you kill one of each type of fish(Pufferfish, tropical fish, salmon, cod)
	you have a 1/50 chance of getting a wet sponge.
	Can be used to make renewable sponge without the use of lightning RNG manipulation,
	which in 1.14+ is impossible, hence the name easier_renweable_sponge.

### [eyeremover.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/eyeremover.sc):
#### By rv3r
	Shift right-click on a filled end portal frame to empty it and receive the eye of ender. Note that any

#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	If you have a stone pick, right click on block to set the area of effect of the hammer(1x1,3x3,5x5).

	Useful for hollowing out large areas.

### [holy_hand_grenades.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/holy_hand_grenades.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	Reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail (R.I.P Terry Jones and Graham Chapman).
	Right clicking with fire charge enchanted with any level of power will shoot it, causing blocks to blow up and fly back as
	falling block entities.
	The higher the power, the further back the blocks go.

### [horse_stats.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/horse_stats.sc):
#### By KingOfTheClouds
	The command /horse_stats prints the health, speed and jump attributes of the horse/donkey/mule the player is looking at.

	Right clicking on an inventory and having partially empty slots in your inventory will refill them from the inventory.
	Left clicking will send your items to any unfilled slots in the inventory.

	locate will tell you first 100 blocks, as well as how many there are in total, and you can tp to them by clicking in chat.
	hist will print a histogram like in gnembon's ancient debris video, but this will accept any block, and if there are less than 	40 blocks for that y level, it will print a nice looking histogram.

### [magic_doors.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/magic_doors.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	If you right click with an empty hand on a bunch of stained glass, it will disappear for a moment and then reappear.
	It's an automated glass sliding door but instead of sliding, the door disappears and allows players to walk through for a short period, and then reappears.

### [playerme.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/playerme.sc):
#### by BisUmTo
	A wrapper around the /player carpet command. It will only allow the caller to affect themselves
	with the player command. This allows for afking, shadowing and such, but not bots, which a lot of
	servers find useful.

### [prospectors_pick.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/prospectors_pick.sc):
#### By gnembonmc

	If you're on the the surface, it will probe in diamond level and show particles for ores, based on the colour.
	If you're in a cave, it will show a direct line ores around you in a small volume.
	Makes branch mining more interesting for sure.
	Fortune 1 shows only iron, coal and redstone.
	Fortune 3 shows diamond, lapis,gold, redstone and emerald, not iron and coal

### [renewable_elytra_trade.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/renewable_elytra_trade.sc):
#### By Firigion
	Renewable elytra through adding a trade to the otherwise useless leatherworker. The trade appears when interacting
	with a letherworker and all conditions for it to appear are met. Said conditions can be totally customizable in the
	app, including the villager being in the end, needing to right click it with an elytra, the elyta being consumed, minimum
	level of the villager and chances of the trade to fail.

### [replace_hotbar.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/replace_hotbar.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	If you run out of an item for any reason, it will be refilled from the hotbar, then shulker boxes in the hotbar.
	Useful for large scale building, or afk sand placing around a monument.

### [replace_inventory.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/replace_inventory.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	Allows a players inventory slots to be refilled when they run out with same blocks/items. First from the other slots in the players inventory,
	and then from shulker boxes containing them, if any in inventory.
	This makes it useful for large scale building, or afk sand placing around a monument.
	I guess its just like a better version of replace_hotbar.sc

### [revive_coral.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/revive_coral.sc):
#### By Ghoulboy
	You can right click on a dead coral block with a water bottle to revive it, consuming the water.
	The coral will be reset to normal, meaning that it will die again if you don't mine it.
	It's useful in liaison with /carpet renewableCorals rule, as it can be used to simplify a coral block farm.

#### By Ghoulboy
	You can shear a coral, dead or alive, and there will be 0-5 drops which can be either coral fans or corals.
	This is not op, as if you don't have silk touch, you will have to do this underwater, and at that stage you 
	will likely be doing this while fighting off drowned, crouching on a magma block.
	In creative it will not drop anything, like for any block.

### [shulkerboxes.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/shulkerboxes.sc):

	Different from `OnePlayerSleeping`, still all real player is required on the server to cause night to pass.

#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	Allows to smash a cave-like hollow in the ground, with random bits jutting out.
	Doesn't drop items, and breaks all blocks, so don't confuse with veinminer.

### [sneak_grow_overpowered.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/sneak_grow_overpowered.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	This random ticks plants in a 23*23*17 volume around the player.
	Blocks near the player will be random ticked more often.

### [speed.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/speed.sc):
#### By Ghoulboy
    This app calculates speed of a player.
    It will display a number in the scoreboard. Divide said number by 100 to get actual speed.
    Speed toggle in minihud is obviously much better.

### [storage_drawers.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/storage_drawers.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Ku73ElDBs

### [veinminer.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/veinminer.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.
	The more the sharpness, the more the veinminer, and it doesn't consume hunger.
	Requires player to be sneaking.
	It's as simple as that.

### [very_basic_overworld_wither_cage_finder.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/very_basic_overworld_wither_cage_finder.sc):
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this.any trade
	It will search in the given radius of blocks for a 3*3 of bedrock, and nothing else.
	It's very basic, hence it's name.

### [villager_auto_trader.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/villager_auto_trader.sc):
#### By Ghoulboy
	When enabled, zombie villagers which can pick up loot, will change any emeralds in their hand for their first villager trade.
	This only works for trades which take only emeralds as a first item, and nothing for the second.
	NB: Zombie villagers will still be hostile and can despawn, so proper care is stilll required.
	Trades happen every 6 seconds, as with piglin bartering.

### [villager_poi.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/villager_poi.sc):

#### By gnembon
	There is a video on his channel about this
	If you hold an ax with Sharpness, stuff will start flying around you at faster and faster speeds
	Vortex 1 is a useful magnet, and Vortex 3 is a crazy random tornado which no-one wants except for a prank or messing around
	I suppose you could use it with TNT to send it smashing into things as a powerful and volatile weapon

### [waypoints.sc](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/waypoints.sc):
#### By Firigion and boyenn
	Adds a server-side waypoints system, where any player can add and teleport to waypoints that any player
	creates. Permissions to	teleport are highly customizable (see https://youtu.be/OF_hY1sTRYY). It also
	features the ability to render a line in direction of a waypoint (see https://youtu.be/0N2qVahMD7s).
