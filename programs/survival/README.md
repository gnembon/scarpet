## Survival scarpet apps in alphabetical order with creator:

### angel_block.sc: 
#### By "Pegasus Epsilon" <pegasus@pimpninjas.org>
	Reimplementation of Angel Blocks from RandomThings mod in scarpet 1.4
	(Please enter an explanation here)

### auto_pickup.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	When you break a block, the item gets tp-ed to player, and left on ground if inventory is full
	ALso works for inventory blocks, delaying the check until they are done to grab the items off the ground

### bridge.sc:
#### By Aplet123
	When holding golden sword(configurable), sneaking and clicking block, the blocks in the offhand will be placed
	Also comes with useful funcs, __set_nbt_in_slot(player, slot, tag_name, tag_value)
	and __get_nbt_value_in_slot(player, slot, tag_name)
	which can be very useful anywhere
	
### easier_renweable_sponge.sc:
#### By Ghoulboy
	If you kill one of each type of fish(Pufferfish, tropical fish, salmon, cod)
	you have a 1/50 chance of getting a wet sponge
	can be used to make renweable sponge without use of lightning RNG manipulation
	which in 1.14+ is impossible, hence the name easier_renweable_sponge

### hammer.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	If you have a stone pick, right click on block to set the area of effect of the hammer(1x1,3x3,5x5)
	Then you can break multiple blocks at the same time, honouring enchantments like fortune or silk touch
	useful to hollow out large areas
	
### holy_hand_grenades.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	Reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail (R.I.P Terry Jones and Graham Chapman)
	Right clicking with fire charge enchanted with any level of power will shoot it, causing blocks to blow up and fly back as
	falling block entities
	The higher the power, the further back the blocks go
	
### inventory_refill.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	Right clicking on an inventory and having partially empty slots in your inventory will refill the mfrom the inventory
	Left clicking will send your items to any unfilled slots in the inventory
	(Please add a better descreption as right now it just sounds like a less laggy storage_drawers.sc)

### magic_doors.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	If you right click with an empty hand on a bunch of stained glass, it will disappear for a moment and then reappear
	(Please input more detailed explanation)
	
### prospectors_pick.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	If you hold a gold pick with fortune, it do a number of things:
	If you're on the the surface, it will probe in diamond level and show particles for ores,based on the colour.
	If you're in a cave, it will shows a direct line ores around you in a small volume.
	Makes branch mining more interesting for sure.
	Fortune 1 shows only iron, coal and redstone.
	Fortune 3 shows diamond, lapis,gold, redstone and emerald, not iron and coal

### replace_hotbar.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	If you run out of an item for any reason, it will be refilled from the hotbar, then shulker boxes in the hotbar
	Useful for large scale building, or afk sand placing around a monument
	
### replace_inventory.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	If you run out of an item for any reason, it will be refilled from the inventory, then shulker boxes
	Useful for large scale building, or afk sand placing around a monument
	I guess its just like a better version of replace_hotbar.sc
	(Please explain better someone!)
	
### revive_coral.sc:
#### By Ghoulboy
	You can right click on a dead coral block with a water bottle to revive it, consuming the water
	The coral will be reset to normal, meaning that it will die again if you don't mine it
	It's useful in liaison with /carpet renewableCorals rule, as it can be used to simplify a coral block farm
	
### signs_for_water_streams.sc:
#### By indoorjetpacks
	Hold any bucket in your offhand while placing signs will place the sign without getting the 'Edit sign message' prompt.
	Useful for placing water/lava flows if you make a lot of them. Looking at you, SciCraft server.
	
### silk_spawners.sc:
#### By "Pegasus Epsilon" <pegasus@pimpninjas.org>
	Reimplementation of Silk Spawners mod in scarpet 1.5
	Allows to silk touch mine spawners if holding a diamond pick with silk touch
	Keep entity that you are spawning when you place back down
	Useful to make a crazy n-tuple spider farm or something like that
	
### smasher.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	Allows to smash a cave-like hollow in the ground, with random bits jutting out.
	Doesn't drop items, and breaks all blocks, so don't confuse with veinminer

### sneak_grow_overpowered.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	This random ticks plants in a 23*23*17 volume around the player
	Blocks near the player will be random ticked more often

### storage_drawers.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Ku73ElDBs
	Cos im too lazy to write all the shit down.
	
### veinminer.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	The more the sharpness, the more the veinminer, and it doesn't consume hunger.
	Requires player to be sneaking.
	It's as simple as that.
	
### very_basic_overworld_wither_cage_finder.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	It will search in the given radius of blocks for a 3*3 of bedrock, and nothing else.
	It's very basic, hence it's name
	
### villager_poi.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	Keeps track of villager poi system?
	(Please enter an explanation, as it quite unclear)

### vortex_effect.sc:
#### By gnembonmc
	There is a video on his channel about this
	If you hold an ax with Sharpness, stuff will start flying around you at faster and faster speeds
	Vortex 1 is a useful magnet, and Vortex 3 is a crazy random tornado which no-one wants except for a prank or messing around
	I suppose you could use it with TNT to send it smashing into things as a powerful and volatile weapon

### Current content creators:
	gnembonmc(obviously)
	Pegasus Epsilon
	Aplet123
	Ghoulboy
	indoorjetpacks
