// Sneak click while placing signs to place it without getting the 'Edit sign message' prompt. Sneak click already skips GUI/interactions for other blocks, why not signs also? Makes sense to me.
// Useful for placing water/lava flows if you make a lot of them. Lookin' at you, SciCraft server.
// tested in Carpet 1.4.24
// https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/releases
//written for scarpet 1.7 in carpet mod 1.4.15+. Both from the amazing gnembon (although...how'd you get this far without knowing that?)

// This version uses regex matching to detect sign items, so it has a chance of supporting datapacks/mods out-of-the-box.
// This may however cause problems where non-sign items are detected as signs and exhibit odd behavior in modded MC.
// The original code based on an explicit whitelist remains available in comments and can be reactivated below.
